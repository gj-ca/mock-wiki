## First things first

**Before You Continue:** You'll need to have done the intro to HTML and CSS 

Lets think about some examples for static web pages that flex our html muscles. How about a mock Wikipedia article? Its just going to be a static webpage that is more informative than stylish, we can ignore the sidebars for now and just focus on the actual article.

At the moment our index.html page is completely empty. What are the important tags that our webpage needs **BEFORE** rendering anything on our site?

We need to declare the `<DOCTYPE>`, which tells the browser how to interpret the information we're giving it.

We also need the `<html>`, it is inside this `<html>` tag where we will be writing the rest of our code.

Inside the `<html>` we are going to add a `<head>` and `<body>` tag. Remember that the `<head>` stores metadata and important references to things like scripts and stylesheets but we won't be using those right now, and that the `<body>` is where we will be writing the html that the user sees on their browser.

Update your index.html so that you have these important tags. Cross-check with the solution once you believe you are done.
